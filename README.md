This Java code calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than a given number (in this case, 1000) and then prints the result.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The code defines a class named `SumOfMultiples`.

2. Inside the class, there is a `public static void main(String[] args)` method, which serves as the entry point of the program. It's where the code execution starts.

3. The code initializes an integer variable named `number` with the value 1000. This variable represents the given number up to which you want to find the sum of multiples.

4. Another integer variable named `sum` is initialized with a value of 0. This variable will store the cumulative sum of multiples of 3 or 5.

5. The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates from `i = 1` to `i < number - 1`. The loop will run for numbers from 1 to 999 (excluding 1000).

6. Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement that checks whether the current value of `i` is a multiple of 3 or 5. This is done by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `i % 3` or `i % 5` equals 0, it means `i` is divisible by 3 or 5, and it is considered a multiple.

7. If `i` is indeed a multiple of 3 or 5, its value is added to the `sum` variable.

8. The loop continues to the next `i` value, and the process repeats until all the numbers less than 1000 have been examined.

9. After the loop finishes, the `sum` variable contains the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 1000.

10. Finally, the code uses `System.out.println` to display the result. It prints the sum along with a message indicating what it represents: "The sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: [sum]."

In summary, this code efficiently calculates the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 by iterating through all numbers from 1 to 999, checking if they are multiples, and accumulating the sum. It's a common example of solving a simple mathematical problem using programming.# Java-Coding-Challenges
